//interface is member of java and it have only the abstract methods.
//we can't create an object of interface 
//class cannot extends interface but it implements the interface using keyword implements.
//if a class implements an interface then it has to provide implementation for all abstract methods or
//class must declared as abstract.

1)  package interface_programs;

    public interface  interface_class {
    public abstract void test1(); //this also same
                 void test2();   //this also same  
}


package interface_programs;


public class p1 implements interface_class { //ob create using p1 for interface_class.
public void test1()
{
System.out.println("from test1 of p1");
}
public void test2()
{
System.out.println("from test2 of p2");
}
public static void main(String[] args)
{
p1 ob=new p1();
ob.test1();
ob.test2();
}
}
------------------------------
output:
from test1 of p1
from test2 of p2
